It\u2019s basically Facebook\u2019s Twitter clone and it works just like Twitter. You create an account - or drag your account from Instagram - find some friends, and start posting. It just works. But it\u2019s also a minimum viable product and the ultimate expression of moving fast and breaking things. While it\u2019s clear that the company has been building this for a while - the app doesn't suck - it is definitely low on features. Discover is nonexistent and DMs are still unavailable. Hashtags don\u2019t work. But, thanks to open source and a huge dev budget, Meta has pulled off something impressive. They stood up an app that got 10 million users in one day and thus far haven\u2019t completely pissed off Twiteratti. First, a bit of context. Threads, in theory, is an interface to the ActivityPub protocol. How that interface will work is currently unclear but you could thread or toot or whatever people on Mastodon from the Threads app. The company knows how to exploit open source and because they got burned on crypto a few years ago, Meta is clearly staying away from making all of our text burps into NFTs or some dumb stuff. BlueSky, on the other hand, is using the open-source AT protocol, which will eventually lead to a delightful VHS vs. Betamax standoff until BlueSky or someone else creates a bridge. In short, Meta bet on the right horse to make something quickly. The first moral? Build quickly using off-the-shelf technology. And don\u2019t try to get too fancy. Then the app launch just worked. Unlike the rest of the apps like Post, Spill, and Homunculous (one of those is fake), Threads was available from day one. If you had an Instagram account you also got a notification and you were able to pop on in a second. This led to users having hundreds if not thousands of friends immediately, reducing the empty room problem. Meanwhile, in competitor land: The second moral? Launch. Zuck basically admitted that was his strategy: Obviously none of us can expect to get 1 billion people on day two but focusing on waitlists while the product and interest stagnates - or focusing on minutae while the market moves on - is a stupid way to build. Finally, Meta read the room. They had a perfect testbed for how not to run a Twitter-like social media service from Twitter itself. They watch Elon torch the place and kept copious notes. The result brings us to our final moral: when your enemy is making a mistake, let them. I, for one, hate Facebook. It\u2019s destroyed democracy, shut down discourse, and commodified attention. That said, maybe Meta has learned a little something over the years and I think this launch - seamless, highly performant, and fun - is evidence of that education. Now we just have to hope the Nazis and crypto bros stay over on Twitter.

      "content": "Threads, a new social media app developed by Meta (formerly known as Facebook), has gained significant attention since its launch. The app, which can be accessed at startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp, has been described as Facebook's version of Twitter.\n\nUsers can create an account on Threads, either by signing up directly or by importing their existing Instagram account. Once registered, they can connect with friends and start posting, similar to how Twitter functions. However, Threads is currently considered a minimum viable product, lacking some key features such as a discover section, direct messages, and functional hashtags.\n\nDespite its limited functionality, Threads has managed to attract an impressive number of users within just one day of its release. Meta's extensive development budget and utilization of open-source technology have contributed to this achievement. The company has successfully avoided the controversies it faced with cryptocurrency in the past and focused on creating a fast and efficient app.\n\nThreads operates as an interface to the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users to interact with platforms like Mastodon. This approach sets Threads apart from BlueSky, another social media app that relies on the open-source AT protocol. The competition between these two protocols may lead to a future showdown reminiscent of the VHS vs. Betamax battle.\n\nMeta's strategy for launching Threads involved prioritizing speed and accessibility. Unlike other apps, such as Post, Spill, and Homunculous, Threads was available immediately upon its release. Users with Instagram accounts received notifications and could start using the app without any delays. This approach helped Threads overcome the challenge of building an active user base from scratch.\n\nMeta also learned from the mistakes made by Twitter in managing a Twitter-like social media service. They observed the controversy surrounding Twitter and took notes on how not to run a platform. This approach has resulted in a seamless, highly performant, and enjoyable user experience on Threads.\n\nWhile some may harbor negative sentiments towards Meta and its parent company, Facebook, the launch of Threads demonstrates the potential for growth and improvement. Meta's ability to learn from past errors and create a successful product launch indicates a level of education and progress. However, concerns remain about the potential presence of extremist groups and cryptocurrency enthusiasts on the platform.\n\nOverall, Threads has made a significant impact in the social media landscape, and its rapid growth suggests that it may become a formidable competitor to existing platforms.
