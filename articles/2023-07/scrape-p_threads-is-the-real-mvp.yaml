It\u2019s basically Facebook\u2019s Twitter clone and it works just like Twitter. You create an account - or drag your account from Instagram - find some friends, and start posting. It just works. But it\u2019s also a minimum viable product and the ultimate expression of moving fast and breaking things. While it\u2019s clear that the company has been building this for a while - the app doesn't suck - it is definitely low on features. Discover is nonexistent and DMs are still unavailable. Hashtags don\u2019t work. But, thanks to open source and a huge dev budget, Meta has pulled off something impressive. They stood up an app that got 10 million users in one day and thus far haven\u2019t completely pissed off Twiteratti. First, a bit of context. Threads, in theory, is an interface to the ActivityPub protocol. How that interface will work is currently unclear but you could thread or toot or whatever people on Mastodon from the Threads app. The company knows how to exploit open source and because they got burned on crypto a few years ago, Meta is clearly staying away from making all of our text burps into NFTs or some dumb stuff. BlueSky, on the other hand, is using the open-source AT protocol, which will eventually lead to a delightful VHS vs. Betamax standoff until BlueSky or someone else creates a bridge. In short, Meta bet on the right horse to make something quickly. The first moral? Build quickly using off-the-shelf technology. And don\u2019t try to get too fancy. Then the app launch just worked. Unlike the rest of the apps like Post, Spill, and Homunculous (one of those is fake), Threads was available from day one. If you had an Instagram account you also got a notification and you were able to pop on in a second. This led to users having hundreds if not thousands of friends immediately, reducing the empty room problem. Meanwhile, in competitor land: The second moral? Launch. Zuck basically admitted that was his strategy: Obviously none of us can expect to get 1 billion people on day two but focusing on waitlists while the product and interest stagnates - or focusing on minutae while the market moves on - is a stupid way to build. Finally, Meta read the room. They had a perfect testbed for how not to run a Twitter-like social media service from Twitter itself. They watch Elon torch the place and kept copious notes. The result brings us to our final moral: when your enemy is making a mistake, let them. I, for one, hate Facebook. It\u2019s destroyed democracy, shut down discourse, and commodified attention. That said, maybe Meta has learned a little something over the years and I think this launch - seamless, highly performant, and fun - is evidence of that education. Now we just have to hope the Nazis and crypto bros stay over on Twitter.

      "content": "Threads, a new social media platform by Meta (formerly known as Facebook), has gained significant attention since its launch. The platform, which can be accessed at startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp, has been dubbed the \"real MVP\" by tech enthusiasts.\n\nThreads functions similarly to Twitter, allowing users to create an account, connect with friends, and start posting. Despite being a minimum viable product, Threads has managed to attract 10 million users in just one day. This achievement is attributed to Meta's utilization of open source technology and a substantial development budget.\n\nAlthough Threads lacks certain features such as a discover section, direct messaging, and functional hashtags, its successful launch has impressed many. Meta's decision to prioritize speed and simplicity over complexity and innovation seems to have paid off. The company has learned from past mistakes, including its ill-fated foray into cryptocurrency, and has chosen to focus on delivering a seamless user experience.\n\nThreads is built on the ActivityPub protocol, which allows users to interact with other platforms like Mastodon. This interoperability is seen as a strategic move by Meta, especially as its competitor BlueSky adopts the open-source AT protocol. Industry experts predict a future clash between the two protocols, reminiscent of the VHS vs. Betamax rivalry.\n\nMeta's approach to launching Threads has also been praised. Unlike other apps that faced delays or relied on waitlists, Threads was available to users from day one. Existing Instagram account holders received notifications and were able to access the platform immediately, resulting in a large user base right from the start. This approach successfully addressed the issue of empty rooms and ensured a vibrant community from the beginning.\n\nMeta's careful observation of Twitter's missteps also played a role in the successful launch of Threads. The company took note of the controversies and challenges faced by Twitter, particularly in relation to hate speech and misinformation. By avoiding these pitfalls, Meta aims to create a more positive and enjoyable user experience.\n\nWhile some critics remain skeptical of Meta's intentions and track record, the seamless and highly performant launch of Threads has impressed many. The platform's success will ultimately depend on its ability to maintain user engagement and address potential issues such as the presence of extremist groups and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nFor those interested in exploring Threads, the web page startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp provides access to the platform. As Meta continues to refine and expand the features of Threads, its impact on the social media landscape remains to be seen."
