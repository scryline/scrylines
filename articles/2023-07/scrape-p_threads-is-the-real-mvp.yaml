It\u2019s basically Facebook\u2019s Twitter clone and it works just like Twitter. You create an account - or drag your account from Instagram - find some friends, and start posting. It just works. But it\u2019s also a minimum viable product and the ultimate expression of moving fast and breaking things. While it\u2019s clear that the company has been building this for a while - the app doesn't suck - it is definitely low on features. Discover is nonexistent and DMs are still unavailable. Hashtags don\u2019t work. But, thanks to open source and a huge dev budget, Meta has pulled off something impressive. They stood up an app that got 10 million users in one day and thus far haven\u2019t completely pissed off Twiteratti. First, a bit of context. Threads, in theory, is an interface to the ActivityPub protocol. How that interface will work is currently unclear but you could thread or toot or whatever people on Mastodon from the Threads app. The company knows how to exploit open source and because they got burned on crypto a few years ago, Meta is clearly staying away from making all of our text burps into NFTs or some dumb stuff. BlueSky, on the other hand, is using the open-source AT protocol, which will eventually lead to a delightful VHS vs. Betamax standoff until BlueSky or someone else creates a bridge. In short, Meta bet on the right horse to make something quickly. The first moral? Build quickly using off-the-shelf technology. And don\u2019t try to get too fancy. Then the app launch just worked. Unlike the rest of the apps like Post, Spill, and Homunculous (one of those is fake), Threads was available from day one. If you had an Instagram account you also got a notification and you were able to pop on in a second. This led to users having hundreds if not thousands of friends immediately, reducing the empty room problem. Meanwhile, in competitor land: The second moral? Launch. Zuck basically admitted that was his strategy: Obviously none of us can expect to get 1 billion people on day two but focusing on waitlists while the product and interest stagnates - or focusing on minutae while the market moves on - is a stupid way to build. Finally, Meta read the room. They had a perfect testbed for how not to run a Twitter-like social media service from Twitter itself. They watch Elon torch the place and kept copious notes. The result brings us to our final moral: when your enemy is making a mistake, let them. I, for one, hate Facebook. It\u2019s destroyed democracy, shut down discourse, and commodified attention. That said, maybe Meta has learned a little something over the years and I think this launch - seamless, highly performant, and fun - is evidence of that education. Now we just have to hope the Nazis and crypto bros stay over on Twitter.

      "content": "Threads, a new social media platform developed by Meta (formerly known as Facebook), has gained significant attention since its launch. The platform, described as Facebook's Twitter clone, allows users to create accounts, find friends, and start posting in a format similar to Twitter. Despite being a minimum viable product, Threads has managed to attract 10 million users within just one day of its release.\n\nOne notable aspect of Threads is its utilization of the ActivityPub protocol, which enables users to interact with other platforms such as Mastodon. Meta's decision to embrace open-source technology and avoid incorporating features like NFTs has been seen as a smart move, given the company's previous missteps in the crypto space. In contrast, competitors like BlueSky are utilizing the open-source AT protocol, which may lead to compatibility issues in the future.\n\nMeta's strategy of building quickly using off-the-shelf technology has paid off, as Threads was available to users from the moment of its launch. This seamless integration with existing Instagram accounts allowed users to immediately connect with hundreds, if not thousands, of friends, eliminating the issue of empty rooms often faced by new social media platforms.\n\nMeta's approach stands in contrast to the strategy of focusing on waitlists or minutiae while interest in the product stagnates. CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the importance of a successful launch, stating that while not everyone can expect to reach 1 billion users on day two, it is crucial to avoid delaying the launch and missing out on market opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, Meta has learned from past mistakes made by Twitter and its handling of controversial figures such as Elon Musk. By observing the negative impact of such missteps, Meta has been able to create a more seamless, high-performing, and enjoyable user experience with Threads.\n\nDespite Meta's controversial history and criticism of Facebook's impact on democracy and discourse, the launch of Threads has been met with cautious optimism. The hope is that Meta's improved approach to social media will attract users away from platforms like Twitter, which have faced criticism for their handling of hate speech and the promotion of cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Threads continues to gain traction, it remains to be seen how it will evolve and compete with established social media giants. However, the initial success of the platform suggests that Meta's strategy of building quickly, learning from past mistakes, and embracing open-source technology may be paying off.\n\nTo read more about Threads, visit the web page here: [https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp](https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp)"
