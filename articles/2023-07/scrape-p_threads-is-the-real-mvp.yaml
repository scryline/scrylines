It\u2019s basically Facebook\u2019s Twitter clone and it works just like Twitter. You create an account - or drag your account from Instagram - find some friends, and start posting. It just works. But it\u2019s also a minimum viable product and the ultimate expression of moving fast and breaking things. While it\u2019s clear that the company has been building this for a while - the app doesn't suck - it is definitely low on features. Discover is nonexistent and DMs are still unavailable. Hashtags don\u2019t work. But, thanks to open source and a huge dev budget, Meta has pulled off something impressive. They stood up an app that got 10 million users in one day and thus far haven\u2019t completely pissed off Twiteratti. First, a bit of context. Threads, in theory, is an interface to the ActivityPub protocol. How that interface will work is currently unclear but you could thread or toot or whatever people on Mastodon from the Threads app. The company knows how to exploit open source and because they got burned on crypto a few years ago, Meta is clearly staying away from making all of our text burps into NFTs or some dumb stuff. BlueSky, on the other hand, is using the open-source AT protocol, which will eventually lead to a delightful VHS vs. Betamax standoff until BlueSky or someone else creates a bridge. In short, Meta bet on the right horse to make something quickly. The first moral? Build quickly using off-the-shelf technology. And don\u2019t try to get too fancy. Then the app launch just worked. Unlike the rest of the apps like Post, Spill, and Homunculous (one of those is fake), Threads was available from day one. If you had an Instagram account you also got a notification and you were able to pop on in a second. This led to users having hundreds if not thousands of friends immediately, reducing the empty room problem. Meanwhile, in competitor land: The second moral? Launch. Zuck basically admitted that was his strategy: Obviously none of us can expect to get 1 billion people on day two but focusing on waitlists while the product and interest stagnates - or focusing on minutae while the market moves on - is a stupid way to build. Finally, Meta read the room. They had a perfect testbed for how not to run a Twitter-like social media service from Twitter itself. They watch Elon torch the place and kept copious notes. The result brings us to our final moral: when your enemy is making a mistake, let them. I, for one, hate Facebook. It\u2019s destroyed democracy, shut down discourse, and commodified attention. That said, maybe Meta has learned a little something over the years and I think this launch - seamless, highly performant, and fun - is evidence of that education. Now we just have to hope the Nazis and crypto bros stay over on Twitter.

      "content": "Threads is the real MVP, according to a recent article by John Biggs on startupstrats.substack.com. The article, titled \"Threads is the real MVP,\" discusses Facebook's new Twitter clone and its successful launch.\n\nIf you've been on the Internet in the past 24 hours, you've probably seen mention of Threads. It's Facebook's answer to Twitter and operates in a similar way. Users can create an account, find friends, and start posting. Despite being a minimum viable product with limited features, Threads has gained significant traction.\n\nThe article acknowledges that while the app lacks certain functionalities such as Discover and DMs, it has still managed to attract 10 million users in just one day. This achievement can be attributed to Meta's utilization of open source technology and a substantial development budget.\n\nThreads is designed as an interface to the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users to interact with Mastodon and other platforms. Unlike its competitor BlueSky, which uses the AT protocol, Meta's choice of technology has proven successful. The article advises startups to build quickly using off-the-shelf technology and avoid unnecessary complications.\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to Threads' success is its seamless launch. Unlike other apps that faced delays or limited availability, Threads was accessible from day one. Users with Instagram accounts received notifications and could easily join the platform. This immediate accessibility helped reduce the problem of empty rooms and fostered rapid user adoption.\n\nThe article highlights Meta's ability to learn from Twitter's mistakes and capitalize on them. Meta observed the controversies surrounding Twitter, including Elon Musk's influence, and took notes. This strategic move allowed Meta to create a highly performant and enjoyable user experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the article acknowledges the negative impact Facebook has had on society but suggests that Meta has learned from past mistakes. The successful launch of Threads demonstrates Meta's growth and improvement. However, the article also expresses hope that divisive communities, such as Nazis and crypto enthusiasts, will remain on Twitter.\n\nTo read the full article, visit startupstrats.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-real-mvp."
