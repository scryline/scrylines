First with investments, when I ran a hedge fund and tried to learn about investing in the public market. Then with advising corporates and trying to help figure out what they ought to do. And later still then, in venture capital, All these pieces of advice contain a grain of truth. Sophie\u2019s post goes from the Graham and Buffett school of value investing to tech-enabled algorithmic trading of RenTech, to macro investing like Tiger to the big picture theories of Dalio to the whole world of private markets where there are thousands of opinions on the best ways to find unicorns. There\u2019s still an infinite amount of information out there but you\u2019ve at least begun to develop your own worldview. You\u2019ve probably either convinced yourself you could develop a consistent edge and that you love the game, or you\u2019ve become jaded and red-pilled and commit to only dollar cost averaging into index funds. It\u2019s not just finance. Every area of life seems to be like this. Like, a friend of mine joined a [TechCo] as a product manager several years ago. And I used to joke that he basically was a consultant to the company\u2019s engineers and their sales people. But product management is also incredibly important. It is critical to making the thing that gets used by all your users after all. And if you look at the world of product management, it too has its types of advice which all seem very good until you look closely. Talk to your users, prioritise ruthlessly, start with \u201cwhy\u201d and not requirements, use data, be fast with a bias for action, coordinate the technologists with the business people. These are all true, but these are all inadequate. Even if you go a level down into the pure action oriented advice, it still is equivalent to building user personas, doing customer interviews, prototyping concepts and running A/B tests, using frameworks like JTBD, building and owning a roadmap, etc. Career coaching is similar. A wide variety of advice that spans the entire spectrum, which at the end makes much of the advice less useful and less worthwhile. And Venture Capital? Something I have experience with and have talked about? Well, there are as many good funds as there are ways to invest. Those who focus only on the entrepreneurs, those who do extensive analyses, those who do market analyses and create theses and spearfish, those who let the \u201cbest\u201d opportunities come to them, and so on and on and on. There is no advice that would suit a new investor or teach them what they ought to do in any situation. There\u2019s just trial by fire. I call this phrase the \u201cexperiential epiphany\u201d. It\u2019s like deja vu, but for an idea you once heard and now it makes sense. Now, some of it is because at the highest level advice kind of becomes pretty generic. They have to compress an enormous amount of insight and most of it is incredibly situational. And what\u2019s common amongst most investment decisions or business decisions is that they don\u2019t recur. The situations might look similar but the market isn\u2019t. Or the world changes. And the decisions we make assuming ceteris paribus turns out to be not How often have you looked back and said \u201chuh, that\u2019s what the cliche actually means\u201d. That\u2019s this phenomenon. 2/ Wittgenstein\u2019s letter There is little that is not worse today because we have become box tickers in oh so many ways. 3/ Invesco has theories on where to invest One of the things I like to do is to to read about what asset managers think about the modern crazy macro environment we find ourselves in. From personal experience most of them are basically throwing spaghetti against the wall, moving pieces a little bit back and forth Over the course of 2022, investors continued to\u00a0extend their investment time horizons resulting in the sixth consecutive annual increase reported through this study. Sovereign wealth funds reported an\u00a0average investment horizon of 11.3\u00a0years, versus\u00a0the 10.7 years reported in\u00a02022. Allocations themselves are hard, with increasing weighting to fixed income and private equity, but they all feel like minor edits at the end of the day. The increase in investment time horizons though feel like playing for time to figure out what to change. This is both speculative and exhaustive, the worst combination The fact that there is no single easy thesis feels a defining characteristic of the modern environment. Unless for AI I guess. Though nobody knows how to invest in that either, unless it\u2019s to buy Nvidia at 30x sales or load up on big tech. 4/ Third spaces to create communities and hold debates have been around forever In the 17th and 18th century, there began a coffee drinking scene in London, bringing with it an incredible scene of intellectual debates and spun off innovation. Soon London was only second to Constantinople in number of coffeehouses! London's coffee craze began in 1652 when Pasqua Ros\u00e9e, the Greek servant of a coffee-loving British Levant merchant, opened London\u2019s first coffeehouse (or rather, coffee shack) against the stone wall of St Michael\u2019s churchyard in a labyrinth of alleys off Cornhill. Coffee was a smash hit; within a couple of years, Pasqua was selling over 600 dishes of coffee a day to the horror of the local tavern keepers. For anyone who\u2019s ever tried seventeenth-century style coffee, this can come as something of a shock \u2014 unless, that is, you like your brew \u201cblack as hell, strong as death, sweet as love\u201d, Some of it was because London\u2019s water was basically not drinkable, and the other alternative was drinking watered down beer. And it worked! It produced banks, insurance companies, global trade. London became a powerhouse. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s only the caffeine that helped, but the fact that we started to have third places where people spent time can\u2019t be underestimated. In many ways that\u2019s what we still want. it soon grew into a forum for literary debate where the stars of literary London \u2014 Addison, Steele, Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot and others \u2014 would assemble each evening, casting their superb literary judgements We think about the existence of substack or twitter or threads as these places, and argue about the world where this ceases to be, it\u2019s as if we can\u2019t really imagine a scenario where we don\u2019t have a place to meet people and conduct conversations. All the while when it started centuries ago (millennia if you count Greece, and you should). The most interesting bit though is this. When we argue the $8 fee for Twitter, we had Penny Universities  as cafes, where there was a price to get a coffee and enter discussion. Traditionally, informed political debate had been the preserve of the social elite. But in the coffeehouse it was anyone\u2019s business \u2014 that is, anyone who could afford the measly one-penny entrance fee. For the poor and those living on subsistence wages, they were out of reach. But they were affordable for anyone with surplus wealth \u2014 the 35 to 40 per cent of London\u2019s 287,500-strong male population who qualified as \u2018middle class\u2019 in 1700 Anything that brings together people to have free flowing conversations in a variety of topics, with cafes specialising as such. 5/ Strikes everywhere! In Hollywood the writers are striking. And now performers are striking too. In the UK the public school teachers have been striking. And now the junior doctors, while senior doctors are picking up the slack. This favour will get returned as the senior doctors go on strike a bit later. The nurses, who are likely around on either side, are also on strike. Over in France, well anyway. All of which are following a similar script. Labour doesn\u2019t get paid enough, especially these days with the prices going higher. Collective bargaining is basically nonexistent. And then you have folks like Bob Iger from Disney earning $27 million minimum a year telling the writers they really shouldn\u2019t be greedy. Anyway the thesis is that the supply/ demand logic is inexorable. The logic goes we can\u2019t get another Bob Iger but we can get plenty writers and performers. Which is true but feels incomplete. Its not that we don\u2019t have many Igers. It\u2019s that we can\u2019t risk trying out too many Igers. The risk of a bad Iger killing Disney is much higher than just paying him his millions. Well, I don\u2019t know if it is much higher, but it\u2019s certainly thought of as much higher. Feels like something we ought to admit, that being risk-averse creates artificial scarcity.

You're right: ceteris paribus is a clinical trial to tease out specific influences and relationships. It's not the real world. The assumption that it will carry over perfectly from artificial model environment to messy reality is bizarre. Expand full comment Reply Top New Community No posts Ready for more?

      "content": "Symposium: The unique uselessness of business advice\n\nIn a recent symposium published on the website Strange Loop Canon, author Rohit Krishnan explores the concept of the unique uselessness of business advice. The article delves into various areas of life and business where advice is abundant but often falls short in providing practical guidance.\n\nKrishnan begins by discussing the world of investing, drawing from personal experiences in running a hedge fund and working in venture capital. He highlights the multitude of investment advice available, from value investing to algorithmic trading to macro investing. Despite the abundance of information, Krishnan argues that there is no one-size-fits-all advice for new investors and that trial and error is often the best teacher.\n\nThe article then shifts to the realm of product management, emphasizing the importance of this role in creating products that are used by consumers. Krishnan acknowledges the various types of advice available in this field, such as talking to users, prioritizing ruthlessly, and using data. However, he argues that even these pieces of advice can be inadequate and that building a consistent edge in product management requires experiential learning.\n\nVenture capital is also explored in the symposium, with Krishnan noting the diverse approaches taken by different funds. He suggests that there is no universal advice that can guide new investors in every situation, emphasizing the importance of learning through experience.\n\nMoving beyond the business world, Krishnan discusses the historical significance of third spaces, such as coffeehouses, in fostering intellectual debates and driving innovation. He draws parallels to modern platforms like Substack and Twitter, highlighting the importance of having spaces for free-flowing conversations and the exchange of ideas.\n\nThe symposium concludes with a discussion on labor strikes, highlighting recent strikes in Hollywood, the UK, and France. Krishnan argues that the supply and demand logic often used to justify low wages fails to consider the risk aversion of organizations, which creates artificial scarcity of highly-paid positions.\n\nOverall, Krishnan's symposium challenges the notion that business advice can provide clear-cut answers and highlights the importance of experiential learning and critical thinking in navigating complex situations. The article serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the limitations of advice in various areas of life and business.\n\nTo read the full symposium, visit: [https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/symposium-the-unique-uselessness](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/symposium-the-unique-uselessness)"
