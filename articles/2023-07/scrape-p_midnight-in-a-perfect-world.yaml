This is a weird thing to say, I know, but after the post-dot-com crash, I was able to see what was coming next. I predicted and followed aspects of the rise of hardware miniaturization, ride-sharing, 3D printing, social media, biotech, and cryptocurrency. I\u2019m not bragging, I\u2019m just saying that the trajectories of these various topics were very clear. But over the past ten years, I\u2019ve been blind to the future. \u201cThe dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is,\u201d said Yoda, and I was right there with him. We just went through a strange period of small improvements to technology without any breakthroughs. The results were problematic. Technology is boring. Every cellphone looks alike. Computer graphics have crossed the lip of the uncanny valley and gotten stuck. Most major technologies - 3D printing, VR, biotech - have been stymied. But all that\u2019s changing. The next ten years will bring us the biggest changes in technology since the last fifty. We are about to see an explosion of technology and cultural change that will engulf us all - if we survive the coming environmental upheaval. In honor of this moment, I\u2019m working on a book this summer. I was inspired by my friend Alejandro Barrera who asked me what I wanted to be doing with my life and the simple answer was I wanted to explain difficult concepts to intelligent people. He and I talked about this on my latest podcast episode in which he really gave me the business. The book is tentatively called Midnight In a Perfect World . It\u2019s a non-fiction exploration of the current state of technology and the future we\u2019re careening into. My goal is to build a meditation and critique similar to Clifford Stoll\u2019s Silicon Snake Oil . I believe we are on the cusp of something huge. We\u2019ve had a few of these inflection points over the years and this one is going to be particularly hairy because it combines multiple types of technology - AI, psychedelics, VR, neuro implants, and even planetary engineering. I need your help. First, please fill out this survey to answer some questions about your view of AI. I\u2019ll also want to interview various experts on these topics so if you\u2019d like to chat, please include your email address. Take Survey This is the first in a series of surveys I\u2019ll be running and I would love your feedback and help. I believe the next 50 years will bring us massive change and prosperity. But right now we\u2019re stumbling in the darkness, wondering what\u2019s next. I hope to shed at least a little light. 6 Share this post Midnight In a Perfect World startupstrats.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Notes Other Share Comments Top New Community No posts Ready for more?

      "content": "Midnight In a Perfect World: A Glimpse into the Future of Technology\n\nJohn Biggs, renowned tech expert and writer, has recently released a thought-provoking article titled \"Midnight In a Perfect World\" on his blog, Startup Strategies. In this captivating piece, Biggs reflects on the past decade of technological advancements and shares his insights on what the future holds.\n\nTo access the full article, readers can visit the following URL: https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/midnight-in-a-perfect-world\n\nBiggs starts by acknowledging his ability to predict and follow various technological trends in the past, such as hardware miniaturization, ride-sharing, 3D printing, social media, biotech, and cryptocurrency. However, he admits that over the last ten years, he has been unable to foresee future developments.\n\nHe notes that the recent period has seen incremental improvements in technology without any groundbreaking innovations. This stagnation has led to a sense of boredom and uniformity in the tech industry, with smartphones looking increasingly similar and computer graphics failing to make significant strides. Major technologies like 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), and biotech have also encountered obstacles.\n\nNevertheless, Biggs believes that the next decade will witness the most substantial technological changes since the last fifty years. He predicts an explosion of technological advancements and cultural shifts, provided humanity successfully navigates the impending environmental challenges.\n\nTo commemorate this pivotal moment, Biggs announces his plans to write a book titled \"Midnight In a Perfect World.\" The book will delve into the current state of technology and explore the future that awaits us. Drawing inspiration from Clifford Stoll's \"Silicon Snake Oil,\" Biggs aims to offer both meditation and critique on the subject matter.\n\nRecognizing the magnitude of the changes ahead, Biggs highlights the convergence of various technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), psychedelics, VR, neuro implants, and even planetary engineering. He invites readers to participate in a survey on AI and offers the opportunity for experts in these fields to be interviewed.\n\nBiggs emphasizes the importance of collaboration and feedback, as he plans to conduct a series of surveys and engage with the community throughout his writing process. He envisions the next 50 years as a period of immense transformation and prosperity, but acknowledges the current uncertainty and the need for illumination.\n\n\"Midnight In a Perfect World\" marks the beginning of an exciting journey into the future of technology.
