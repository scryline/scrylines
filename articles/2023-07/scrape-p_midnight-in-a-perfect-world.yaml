This is a weird thing to say, I know, but after the post-dot-com crash, I was able to see what was coming next. I predicted and followed aspects of the rise of hardware miniaturization, ride-sharing, 3D printing, social media, biotech, and cryptocurrency. I\u2019m not bragging, I\u2019m just saying that the trajectories of these various topics were very clear. But over the past ten years, I\u2019ve been blind to the future. \u201cThe dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is,\u201d said Yoda, and I was right there with him. We just went through a strange period of small improvements to technology without any breakthroughs. The results were problematic. Technology is boring. Every cellphone looks alike. Computer graphics have crossed the lip of the uncanny valley and gotten stuck. Most major technologies - 3D printing, VR, biotech - have been stymied. But all that\u2019s changing. The next ten years will bring us the biggest changes in technology since the last fifty. We are about to see an explosion of technology and cultural change that will engulf us all - if we survive the coming environmental upheaval. In honor of this moment, I\u2019m working on a book this summer. I was inspired by my friend Alejandro Barrera who asked me what I wanted to be doing with my life and the simple answer was I wanted to explain difficult concepts to intelligent people. He and I talked about this on my latest podcast episode in which he really gave me the business. The book is tentatively called Midnight In a Perfect World . It\u2019s a non-fiction exploration of the current state of technology and the future we\u2019re careening into. My goal is to build a meditation and critique similar to Clifford Stoll\u2019s Silicon Snake Oil . I believe we are on the cusp of something huge. We\u2019ve had a few of these inflection points over the years and this one is going to be particularly hairy because it combines multiple types of technology - AI, psychedelics, VR, neuro implants, and even planetary engineering. I need your help. First, please fill out this survey to answer some questions about your view of AI. I\u2019ll also want to interview various experts on these topics so if you\u2019d like to chat, please include your email address. Take Survey This is the first in a series of surveys I\u2019ll be running and I would love your feedback and help. I believe the next 50 years will bring us massive change and prosperity. But right now we\u2019re stumbling in the darkness, wondering what\u2019s next. I hope to shed at least a little light. 6 Share this post Midnight In a Perfect World startupstrats.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Notes Other Share Comments Top New Community No posts Ready for more?

      "content": "Midnight In a Perfect World: A Glimpse into the Future of Technology\n\nBy John Biggs\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nFor the last decade, predicting the future has been a challenge for tech enthusiasts and experts alike. However, John Biggs, a renowned technology commentator, believes that we are on the brink of a technological revolution that will surpass anything witnessed in the past fifty years. In his latest web content, titled \"Midnight In a Perfect World,\" Biggs explores the current state of technology and the exciting future that lies ahead.\n\nTo access the full article, click here: [https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/midnight-in-a-perfect-world](https://startupstrats.substack.com/p/midnight-in-a-perfect-world)\n\nIn his article, Biggs reflects on his ability to accurately predict and follow the rise of various technological advancements, such as hardware miniaturization, ride-sharing, 3D printing, social media, biotech, and cryptocurrency. However, he notes that over the past ten years, he has been unable to foresee the future. Biggs attributes this to a period of small technological improvements without any significant breakthroughs, resulting in a sense of stagnation and boredom in the tech industry.\n\nBut according to Biggs, this is all about to change. He predicts that the next decade will bring about the most significant technological and cultural transformations since the last fifty years. Biggs emphasizes that this explosion of technology and cultural change will occur alongside the impending environmental upheaval, which poses its own set of challenges.\n\nInspired by his friend Alejandro Barrera, Biggs has embarked on writing a book tentatively titled \"Midnight In a Perfect World.\" The book aims to explore the current state of technology and provide insights into the future that awaits us. Drawing inspiration from Clifford Stoll's \"Silicon Snake Oil,\" Biggs intends to offer a meditation and critique on the intersection of technology and society.\n\nTo gather valuable insights and perspectives, Biggs invites readers to participate in a survey on their views of artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, he expresses his interest in interviewing experts in various fields related to AI, psychedelics, virtual reality (VR), neuro implants, and planetary engineering.\n\nBiggs acknowledges that we are currently stumbling in the darkness, uncertain about what lies ahead. However, he remains optimistic that the next 50 years will bring profound change and prosperity. Through his book and ongoing surveys, Biggs aims to shed some light on the future and provide a glimpse into the exciting possibilities that await us.\n\nTo stay updated on Biggs' work and contribute to the ongoing discussions, readers are encouraged to subscribe to his newsletter.\n\n\u00a9 2023 John Biggs\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice"
