      "content": "In a recent YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGefZDJDjIw), the horror Guru discusses the highly anticipated meta slasher horror film, Scream Six. While this film is the sixth installment in the Scream franchise, it is actually the second film directed by team Radio Silence, known for their work on films like Devils Do and Ready or Not. The horror Guru expresses his mixed feelings about their previous film, Scream 5, but ultimately enjoyed it for its ability to stay true to the original vibe of the franchise while introducing new concepts and characters.\n\nHowever, the horror Guru is quick to point out that Scream Six takes the franchise to a whole new level of insanity. He describes it as the most bonkers Scream film to date, which is saying a lot considering the franchise's reputation for being wacky. Despite the film's flaws and clunky execution, the horror Guru praises its ability to shock and surprise, particularly with its opening kills.\n\nOne aspect of the film that the horror Guru particularly appreciates is the portrayal of Ghost Face, the iconic killer in the Scream franchise. He describes this version of Ghost Face as the most brutal and terrifying yet, which is a refreshing change for the series. However, he does mention that the ultimate reveal of Ghost Face's identity is over-the-top and lessens the character's scare factor.\n\nThe horror Guru also discusses the characters in the film, specifically the \"core four\" who survived the previous installment. He praises their performances and believes that they carry the film well, even suggesting that the franchise may not need the legacy characters like Sydney and Gail anymore.\n\nAddressing the film's meta commentary, the horror Guru appreciates the social commentary on social media and its connection to fandoms. However, he does feel that some of the scenes discussing this topic feel forced and clunky compared to the natural dialogue found in previous Scream films.\n\nOverall, the horror Guru concludes that Scream Six is a flawed but enjoyable film that fans of the franchise will likely appreciate. He expresses his anticipation for a potential Scream Seven and hopes that the next installment will allow the new characters to shine without relying too heavily on the legacy characters.\n\nTo read the horror Guru's full rankings of the Scream franchise and to join the discussion on the best film in the series, viewers are encouraged to visit the video's comments section."
