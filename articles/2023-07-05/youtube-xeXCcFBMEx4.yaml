      "content": "In a shocking revelation, a new report has exposed missed warning signs and negligence surrounding the company behind the ill-fated Titan submersible that imploded during a mission to the Titanic. The report, obtained by The New Yorker, was written by David Lockridge, a former employee of Ocean Gate who claims he was wrongfully terminated for raising concerns about the sub's safety.\n\nLockridge had sent an ominous email to a colleague, expressing his worries about the doomed vessel. He described it as \"an accident waiting to happen\" and expressed concerns about then CEO Stockton Rush's reckless behavior, stating, \"He kills himself and others in a quest to boost his ego.\" Tragically, Rush was among the five people who lost their lives in the submarine disaster.\n\nThe New Yorker's Ben Taub, who wrote the detailed report, shed light on the numerous issues Lockridge had discovered during his inspection of the sub. As the director of Marine Operations, Lockridge was responsible for ensuring the sub's safety during the testing phase. However, his concerns were constantly dismissed by the company.\n\nLockridge decided to compile a comprehensive inspection report, detailing all the problems he found, and submitted it to Stockton Rush and Tony Nelson, the director of engineering. The report, dated January 18th, 2018, revealed alarming flaws in the sub's construction. Glue was coming off the ballast bags, mounting bolts were at risk of rupturing, sealing faces had punch holes, and grooves deviated from standard parameters. The sub was a ticking time bomb.\n\nOne of Lockridge's major concerns was the use of carbon fiber for the pressure boundary of the sub, which keeps people alive at depths where the external water pressure is about 6,000 pounds per square inch. Carbon fiber is not suitable for deep ocean submersibles as it is not designed to withstand compression. Lockridge discovered that the core of the sub was filled with holes and was porous, making it highly unsafe. He refused to sign off on the sub's safety, leading to his termination by Rush.\n\nThe report also highlighted Rush's personal offense to criticism and his resistance to having the submersible classified. Lockridge knew individuals outside of Ocean Gate, including the co-head of a company that had a classed titanium sub. This co-head warned Rush about the dangers of an unclassified sub, but Rush dismissed it, claiming that safety arguments were hindering innovation. Rush's hubris and determination to beat physics ultimately led to the sub's failure.\n\nThe report points out the importance of classing a submersible to ensure its safety. Lockridge's report emphasized that the submersible was not classified, making it illegal to carry passengers. Ocean Gate had misclassified the passengers as mission specialists to bypass regulations. This lack of proper classification and safety measures was a clear violation of U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nLockridge, after being fired, raised his concerns with the U.S. government, sharing his report with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The report was then forwarded to the U.S. Coast Guard, but there is no evidence of any follow-up action. Lockridge's efforts to prevent the tragedy were met with legal battles and financial burdens.\n\nThe New Yorker's report serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of prioritizing safety over innovation. It exposes the dangers of disregarding warnings and cutting corners in the pursuit of technological advancements. The tragic loss of lives in the Titan submersible disaster should serve as a reminder that accountability and responsibility are crucial when it comes to ensuring the safety of any venture, especially those involving high-risk environments like deep-sea exploration.\n\nTo watch the video that sheds light on the shocking revelations surrounding the Titan submersible, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeXCcFBMEx4"
