      "content": "In a recent YouTube video, horror enthusiasts and hosts of the \"Blood Splattered Vlog,\" the Horror Guru and Count Dracula, discuss the latest installment in the Evil Dead franchise, titled \"Evil Dead Rise.\" The video, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtbdA_z1FQ, features a detailed discussion of the film's plot, characters, and overall tone.\n\nAccording to the hosts, \"Evil Dead Rise\" is not quite a sequel or a remake, but rather a standalone sequel that exists within the Evil Dead remake universe. The film deviates from the traditional cabin-in-the-woods setting and instead takes place in an apartment complex, introducing a new group of characters, including two families and a group of children. The hosts note that the level of gore and violence in this film surpasses that of previous Evil Dead movies, with an emphasis on sadistic and gruesome acts.\n\nOne of the major differences between this film and its predecessors is the portrayal of the Candarian demons. The hosts describe these demons as more sadistic and prone to inflicting mutilation on others, particularly children. They also mention that the film incorporates a significant amount of blood, with gallons upon gallons being used throughout.\n\nThe hosts clarify that the main character of \"Evil Dead Rise,\" Beth, is not Mia from the 2013 Evil Dead remake, but a completely new character. Beth, a punk rock chick who discovers she is pregnant, flies back to visit her sister and her sister's family. However, things take a dark turn when demons are unleashed upon the unsuspecting residents of the apartment complex.\n\nThe video also touches upon the film's connection to the Necronomicon, a recurring element in the Evil Dead franchise. The hosts mention that the film references the existence of three volumes of the Necronomicon, with the third volume being the focus of this movie.\n\nOverall, the hosts express their adoration for \"Evil Dead Rise,\" praising its sadistic nature and the introduction of new elements to the franchise. They note that while they still prefer the 2013 Evil Dead remake, this film excels in its meanness and the terrifying portrayal of the demons. The hosts also appreciate the film's exploration of motherhood as a central theme, as well as its ability to create a sense of isolation and inescapability within the apartment complex setting.\n\nDespite their positive review, the hosts do offer a minor criticism regarding a scene involving the third volume of the Necronomicon. They express a desire to see the full realization of the tentacled creature depicted in the book, which they feel was not fully delivered in the film.\n\nIn conclusion, the hosts highly recommend \"Evil Dead Rise\" to horror fans, noting its success at the box office and reaffirming the enduring popularity of the horror genre. They caution, however, that the film contains graphic scenes involving the brutalization of children, which may be triggering for some viewers.\n\nTo follow the hosts and their horror-related content, viewers can find the Horror Guru on YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, and Instagram under the username \"the horror Guru.\" Count Dracula can be found on YouTube under the username \"Counting Jack\" and on Twitter and Instagram under the handle \"satanicjacula.\" Both hosts have Patreon pages for those interested in supporting their work."
