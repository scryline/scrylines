      "content": "- [Eva] Today I'm traveling\nto what is arguably\nthe most isolated remote\ntown in the United States\noutside of Alaska.\n- 18 of us live here year-round.\n- It happens to sit at the end\nof a very remote, long dirt road\nwith no school, no\nhospital, and no supermarket\nfor 100 miles in every direction.\nThis was a busy town back in its heyday.\nI'm taking several hours to drive here\nto see what it's like to live in a place\nthat's just so detached\nfrom the busy, crowded, and\nhyper convenient side of America\nthat most of us know.\nIt must be one of the most beautiful roads\nI've ever driven down.\nAnd on a more personal note, I wonder\nis this a place I could\never move to and call home?\nIf you live here, you'd\nbe part of that community.\n(light music)\nWhy would anyone come here?\nI mean, I think it's a valid question.\nAbout 50 miles ago, I got\non this narrow lonely road\nthat's just been getting worse and worse\nand sucking me deeper and deeper\ninto this remote, vast landscape.\nThere's no towns.\nI passed maybe five cars along the way,\na few houses, and this road\nonly leads to Jarbidge.\nThere's nothing else at the end.\nYou know, it kind of\nreminds me of New York City,\nbut like the opposite. (laughs)\nLike in New York City, you\ncan't get away from people.\nOut here, it's like, \"Where is everybody?\"\n(light music)\nHere is the first problem with reaching\nthis remote town I'm traveling to.\nIt's in Nevada, but in order to reach it,\nyou have to drive through Idaho\nbecause it's the only way\nthat's open year-round.\nThe next problem,\nthe next closest gas\nstation is 60 miles away.\nThe closest city is 100 miles away.\nFor about an hour and a\nhalf en route to Jarbidge,\nthere are no services as\nfar as the eye can see.\n(light music)\nEventually, the pavement ends\nand the only road that leads\nto Jarbidge becomes dirt.\n18 miles of dirt.\n- My name is Paul.\n- Hi, Paul.\n- I work on the ranch, like I'm up at\n(dog barking)\nthat camp over there.\n- Oh, that's so cool.\nIs it worth visiting?\nI mean, it's like a very long way.\n- Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah?\n- Yeah, that's what\nmakes it interesting is\nmeeting people like you.\n- Yeah?\n- No, really.\nYou're doing adventurous stuff.\n- Yeah!\n- I used, I rode a\nmotorcycle up to Alaska.\n- You did?\n- I worked on remote ranches\nup in Canada and stuff like that.\n- Oh, that's so cool.\n- Jason and Jane will\ntake real good care you.\n- Where do I find Jason and Jane?\n- They'll be, well, right\nnow this is probably closed,\nbut right across the\nstreet, diagonal this way.\n- Yeah.\n- The Outdoor Inn,\nit's a nice bar and grill.\n- Okay.\n- They have hotel rooms,\nbut I kind of figure you're a camper.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt was very nice chatting with Paul.\nHe reassured me that\nJarbidge is worth visiting\ndespite the really long,\nreally remote road.\nAnd he gave me a mission,\nwhich is to say hi to Jane and Jason\nat the Outdoor Inn.\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\nWhere else in the United States\nwould you run into a total\nstranger 20 miles from town,\nenjoy a nice chat, and have them ask you\nto say hi to their friends?\nIt felt like I was entering\na very small world within a world.\nAnd I had so many questions\nbrewing in my mind.\nWhat kind of people\nend up living out here?\nAnd why do they choose to live\nso far from everyone else?\n(light music)\nYou know, there's a part of me\nthat wants to keep this place a secret.\n(Eva laughing)\nMay not be a national\npark or anything, but wow.\nIt must be one of the most beautiful roads\nI've ever driven down.\n(light music)\nYep, it definitely felt\nlike I was entering\na whole different dimension,\nas if I was driving to some\nmythical fairytale destination.\nThat is until the UPS truck\npassed me on the road.\nHoly crap, that just answered\nmy number one question,\nwhich was \"Does UPS deliver here?\"\nThey clearly do.\n(light music)\nI mean, wow, that's a long way\nto deliver just a few packages.\n(light music)\nSeeing these delivery trucks make the trek\nall the way here made me wonder.\nHow do the locals overcome\ndifficulties living so far away?\nWhat if you have an accident?\nWhat if your car breaks down?\nWhere do your kids go to school?\nWell, I'll find all of that out soon.\nFor now, all I need to know\nis where I'm gonna be\ncamping for the night.\nHappy, boy?\nTwist.\nYes!\nIt's been a really long day of driving\nand it's getting a little bit late\nso I found this beautiful\ndispersed campsite.\nI mean, it's just so\namazing right by the river.\nI'm like two miles away from Jarbidge.\nSo gonna wake up tomorrow morning\nand go and check out the town.\nBut for now, I'm gonna make some food,\nmake a little of fire,\njust enjoy the nature here.\nTruth be told, it wasn't just\ncuriosity that led me here.\nI've been trying to find a place\nto lay down some roots somewhere.\nThe idea of living in a very\nremote town, close to nature,\nbut a place that has a\nstrong sense of community,\nhonestly, it sounds like a fairytale.\nSo I wanted to come out\nhere and see for myself\nwhether I could ever live\nin a place like this.\n(Eva laughing)\nGet it, get it, get it, get it.\nWell, it's just me out here.\nThere's nobody else. Completely empty.\nHey, guys, just hopping on\nhere real quick to let you know\nthat there is a director's\ncommentary version\nof this very video over\non my Patreon page.\nWith this specific video,\nI did not know anybody in Jarbidge.\nLike my kind of mission was to\ngo there and talk to someone\nbut I didn't know a single soul.\nIn the director's commentary series,\nI take you behind the\nscenes of all of my videos,\ngiving you some of the insights\ninto what it actually takes\nto make these films happen.\nIt is interesting just how\nmuch a video can change\nbecause of or thanks to an interviewee\nwho is either great\nand entertaining or a little bit shy.\nIn the specific case of this video,\nI tell you all about how\nthis idea came about,\nhow I found this little town,\nsome of the risks that I had to take\nin making this film happen,\nas well as some of the inherent\nchallenges and difficulties\nthat come with interviewing\npeople as a filmmaker.\nAnyway, I hope that you get\na chance to check it out.\nHere is the link, and\nnow back to the video.\n(light music)\nAny advice for making\nfires with wet firewood?\nExcept for bring your own?\n(light music)\nI'm just gonna make the\nmost of it while it lasts\nand warm myself up.\nYou wanna go inside?\nYeah?\n(light music)\nWell, since my fire didn't\nwork out, courtesy of wet wood,\nI've decided to make\nmyself a veggie burger.\nNow, in doing so,\nI have somehow managed to burn my pot.\nOh my God.\nTa-da!\nWelcome to the zu Beck Family Extravaganza\nwhich is just a culinary\nmasterpiece as always.\nYou know me.\nAnd here on this wonderful plate,\nI've got some fake meat,\nfake cheese, fake mayonnaise, (laughs)\nreal chili sauce, and real sauerkraut.\nAnd as a bonus, a little bonus,\nhere, I got me some fake beer.\nSo basically I'm having\na fake dinner tonight.\n(light music)\nGood morning.\nGood morning, bubba.\nHi. Hi, buddy.\n(light music)\nYou get a sense of just\nhow remote this town is\neven before you enter it,\nlike way before you enter it.\nSo I'm here maybe like two miles away\nand there's a sign here for Elko.\nElko is in Nevada.\nJarbidge is also in Nevada.\nBut the only road to actually\nreach Nevada from this town\nis to go up this really rough,\nreally steep mountain road\nwhich is not maintained in the winter.\nSo in reality, the only reliable way\nto access Jarbidge is through Idaho.\n- No, I can't get through there.\n- No?\n- No.\n- I'm not gonna try. No,\ndon't worry. (laughs)\n- Oh, okay.\n- All right, have a good day.\n- Have a good day.\n- Bye.\nSo this nice gentleman just\nwent up the mountain in his ATV\nand he told me that it's not possible.\nThere's too much snow, fallen trees.\nAnd it's June. (laughs)\nIt's June. (laughs)\n(light music)\nWelcome to Jarbidge, population 18.\nThis street here is called,\nyep, you guessed it, Main Street\nand it's home to pretty\nmuch the entire town.\nOh my God, this town is so cool.\nIt's literally like a little alpine town\njust nestled in this\ngorgeous remote valley.\nThe story of Jarbidge\nis just like the story\nof so many other mining\ntowns across the Wild West.\nIn the early 1900s, word got out\nthat someone found gold up here.\nProspectors moved in and\nsoon this remote outpost\nbecame a busy gold mining town,\nhome to hundreds of people,\nall hoping to find their fortunes here.\nAnd these are original\nearly 20th century cabins\nthat actually used to be brothels.\nSo there's about five of these,\nand all five were brothels.\nThis was a busy town back in its heyday.\n1,500 miners lived here, looking for gold.\nThere was bars and\nrestaurants and eateries\nand shops and brothels too.\nI mean, you couldn't tell now, but\nhow times change, hey?\n(light music)\nThere's just so many things\nto say about Jarbidge.\nI mean, one of the\nthings is that this town\nhas no paved roads, right?\nIt's all dirt.\nThere's no traffic lights.\nThere's like one shop.\nBarely, I mean, it's closed.\nBut there is a jail. (laughs)\nJarbidge jail.\n(light music)\nWell, the trading post is closed\nand the judge in nowhere in sight,\nso I think I'm gonna pass up on this,\nbut the jail closed in 1945.\nAnd interestingly enough,\nin the criminal history of Jarbidge,\nthe last stagecoach robbery\nin the United States\nactually took place here.\n(light music)\nIt's just started raining,\nwhich is the perfect excuse\nto go into the cafe and\nsee if they have coffee,\nmaybe some local specialties.\nOne of the cons of living in Jarbidge\nis probably the very\nlimited restaurant scene.\nHi.\n- [Beverly] Hi.\n- One of the pros of living in Jarbidge\nis probably the very\nlimited restaurant scene.\nBecause if you lived here, this is where\nall your local friends would come together\nevery Friday night.\nYou end up knowing the\nlocal drunk or being one.\nYou'd know the bartender,\nthe chef, the owner,\nand everybody who comes\nthrough these doors.\nSure enough, the fabled\nJane appeared in front of me\nwithin a few moments of my arrival.\nWait, you're Jane?\n- [Jane] Yes.\n- And by any chance, is\nyour husband called Jason?\n- [Jane] Yeah.\n- [Eva] Jane sent Jason my way.\nTogether, they run the local restaurant,\nthe bar, the hotel, and the gift shop.\nI wanted to ask Jason\nwhat life was really like in Jarbidge.\nJarbidge has how many full-time residents?\n- 18 of us live here year-round.\nI was raised here.\n- [Eva] Okay.\nWhat was that like as a kid?\n- Awesome. Way better\nthan being in the city.\n- [Eva] Oh, yeah?\n- Our school here quits\nat eighth grade, so having\nto go to high school\nin the city was culture shock,\nwhich is why I'm back here now.\n- [Eva] So with 18 people\nliving here full-time,\nis there a school?\n- [Jason] Yep, there was a\nschool. It shut down in 2002.\n- [Eva] Maybe not the\nbest idea to come here\nwith kids if you don't wanna homeschool.\n- It would be a great idea.\nWe'd just have more people.\nWe need more year-round residents.\n- [Eva] Oh, yeah?\n- Somebody to help take care of the roads,\nbe on the fire department-\n- [Eva] Right.\n- help take care of the water plant.\nThings that need to be done around town.\nThe average age in this\ntown 70. There's 7 over 80.\n- [Eva] Wow.\n- Yeah.\nJane and I are the fourth\nand fifth youngest in town.\nAnd there's only three younger than us.\nEverybody else is old enough\nto be our grandparents.\n- [Eva] Do you ever feel,\nlike isolated in any way?\n- Never.\nGrowing up here, it's what I know\nand what I've always liked.\nAnd I've worked on all the\nranches around this country\nso I've always lived in remote areas\nand worked around very few people.\nSo it's always been home to me.\n- [Eva] And I'm assuming\nthat the community\nis quite close-knit, right?\n- Everybody knows everybody.\n- [Eva] Right. Is that a good thing?\n- Most of the time. (laughs)\n- [Eva] Most of the time. I like that.\nVery diplomatic.\n- Yep.\nIf anybody needs help,\nanybody will help anybody anytime.\n- [Eva] Right.\n- You kinda have to\nwhen you're this far out.\n- [Eva] Yeah, it's very different\nliving in the city, where\noften you won't even\nknow your neighbors.\n- Nope.\nAnd you walk by thousands\nof people every day\nand never even look up at them.\n- [Eva] Yeah.\n- Here everybody\nsmiles and waves.\nYou pass somebody in the canyon,\nthey wave to you when you're driving by.\n- [Eva] Yeah, it's so true.\n- If you're stopped on\nthe side of the road,\nthey stop and ask if you're\nall right or if you need help.\n- [Eva] Yeah, it's so true.\nEvery single person I've\npassed on the way here\nor in town has at least waved, you know?\nWhich is really sweet. Really nice.\n- It's kind of the old style\nOld West community.\n- [Eva] Right.\n- Not many of them left anymore.\nIt's kind of a step back in time up here.\n- [Eva] It is. Of the good kind. (laughs)\n- Very good.\n- [Eva] What do you think is\nthe main draw of Jarbidge?\n- [Jason] The scenery.\nYou've traveled around a bit.\nIf you didn't know you were in Nevada,\nyou'd never guess right now.\n- [Eva] Never. Like I'm used to seeing\njust the desert in Nevada, right?\n- [Jason] Yep, and that's\nwhat everybody thinks of\nbecause all the major highways\ngo through the Alkali flats.\n- [Eva] Right.\n- [Jason] So they think,\n\"Oh, this is a great place\nfor a nuclear waste dump\".\nBut you get 10, 15 miles off\nof any one of those roads,\nall the canyons have fresh water,\ngreen grass, and an abundance of wildlife.\nBut people never get\noff the road to see it.\n- [Eva] So you've got\n18 full-time residents\nand then how many grocery stores?\n- Just one. Two bars and two restaurants.\nA hotel and a motel.\nWe have a gas station.\n- [Eva] How many mechanics?\n- We have two.\n- [Eva] And doctors?\n- No doctors.\nWe have one retired nurse that's here.\n- [Eva] How many paved roads?\n- None. It's 18 miles\nto the nearest pavement.\n- [Eva] But there is a fire brigade.\n- Yep, we have a\nvolunteer fire department.\n- [Eva] What happens if\nsomeone gets very sick\nor there's a medical emergency?\n- We have an ambulance across the street.\nWe're all first responders and\nwe take you down to the dump.\nAnd then that's where\nthe helicopter lands.\n- [Eva] Right. Not just down to the dump.\n- Yeah, we take you to the\ndump when you're broken\nand then you go away.\n(both laughing)\nThis is fry sauce.\n- [Eva] Fry sauce. And\nwhat exactly is fry sauce?\n- It's basically Thousand\nIsland without the pickle.\n(Eva laughing)\n- [Eva] A local specialty.\n- Yeah.\n- So Jase was just saying\nthat this is something that you'll find\nonly in southern Idaho or northern Nevada.\nAll right, let's try\nthis famous fry sauce.\n(light upbeat music)\nIt's really good. Mm-hm.\nIt's got like a little bit of tang.\nIt's great.\n- [Jason] Perfect.\n- [Eva] Okay, so this is\nJane's local gift shop.\nJarbidge Jane's. Is that?\n- Jarbidge Jane's Gift Shop. (laughs)\n- And I love these tops. I\nactually got one of these.\nBut I'm gonna show you\nsomething really funny.\n(light upbeat music)\n(Eva laughing)\n- [Jane] What the hell's a Jarbidge?\n- What the hell's a Jarbidge?\nI feel like if you have\na T-shirt like this\nor a tank top like this and\nyou walk around town with it,\nyou're part of like a very secret club.\nA very secret secret society. (laughs)\n- We have a camo version too.\n- Love it.\nI love this.\n(light upbeat music)\nOne of these stickers is\ngoing up on Odyssey right now.\nSo as I prepare to leave the town,\nI'm gonna do the honors\nand put it right up there. (laughs)\nYou know, once in a while\nI'll end up in a place\nthat is really, really hard to leave.\nAnd Jarbidge is really pretty.\nThe nature here is beautiful.\nIt's gorgeous.\nBut best thing about visiting\nthis little town for me\nwas just getting to know some\nof the people that live here.\nYou know, Jane and Jase,\nand Beverly at the restaurant,\nand Paul yesterday.\nEverybody was so kind and\nso nice and so welcoming.\nIt just really felt like\nif you live here, you'd\nbe part of that community.\nAnd at the end of the day, isn't that\none of the most important\nthings about living somewhere\nis having a community around you?\nGood neighbors, good people.\nWell, could I see myself living here?\nHmm, I'm still thinking about it.\nI think they were joking,\nbut Jason and Jane\ninvited me to come and\nwork at their restaurant.\nThey have no idea how bad of a cook I am.\nMaybe I just won't tell them\nand bookmark their offer\nfor the future. (laughs)\nBut for now, I'm heading further north\nin search of a place to call home.\n(light music)"

      "content": "In a recent YouTube video titled \"Exploring the Most Isolated Town in the United States,\" travel vlogger Eva takes her viewers on a journey to Jarbidge, a remote town in Nevada. The video, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uacxPmj2PlA, showcases the breathtaking scenery, introduces viewers to the town's residents, and explores what it's like to live in such an isolated community.\n\nEva begins her adventure by driving along a long dirt road that leads to Jarbidge. With no school, hospital, or supermarket within 100 miles, the town is truly detached from the busy, crowded side of America. Despite the challenges of reaching Jarbidge, Eva is captivated by the natural beauty of the road and wonders if she could ever call this place home.\n\nUpon arriving in Jarbidge, Eva meets Paul, a local resident who reassures her that the town is worth visiting. Paul shares stories of his own adventures, including riding a motorcycle to Alaska and working on remote ranches in Canada. He directs Eva to the Outdoor Inn, where she meets Jane and Jason, the owners of the local restaurant, bar, hotel, and gift shop.\n\nEva is intrigued by the close-knit community in Jarbidge. With only 18 full-time residents, everyone knows each other and is willing to lend a helping hand. Jason explains that the average age in the town is 70, and there is a need for more year-round residents to contribute to the community.\n\nDespite the lack of amenities, Jarbidge offers stunning scenery that surprises many visitors. The town is nestled in a remote valley, surrounded by fresh water, green grass, and an abundance of wildlife. Jason points out that the perception of Nevada as a desert is quickly dispelled once visitors venture off the major highways.\n\nEva also explores the town's history, which is tied to gold mining in the early 1900s. She visits original cabins that were once brothels and learns about the last stagecoach robbery in the United States, which occurred in Jarbidge. The town's jail, which closed in 1945, serves as a reminder of its colorful past.\n\nThroughout her visit, Eva is struck by the sense of community in Jarbidge. Residents wave and smile at each other, and everyone is willing to help one another. Eva contemplates the appeal of living in such a place, where neighbors become friends and a strong sense of belonging is fostered.\n\nAs Eva prepares to leave Jarbidge, she reflects on the kindness and warmth she experienced from the town's residents. She ponders the possibility of living in such a community and even jokingly entertains the idea of working at Jane and Jason's restaurant.\n\nIn the end, Eva continues her search for a place to call home, but her time in Jarbidge has left a lasting impression. The video serves as a reminder of the importance of community and the beauty that can be found in even the most remote corners of America.\n\nTo watch Eva's video and learn more about her experience in Jarbidge, visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uacxPmj2PlA."
