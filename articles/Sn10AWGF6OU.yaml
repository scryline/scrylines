join me on a little adventure for a
moment because I'd like to talk about
dreams not as like a psychologist or
anything I'm not about to hold up Roar
shacks and ask you what you see in the
ink blots and try and tie it to like
some Trauma from when your high school
bully puts your head in the toilet and
flushed it I want to talk about dream
jobs specifically because 20 years ago
if you asked a child what their dream
job is you'd probably get some silly
things like a professional ice cream
tester getting paid to try different ice
cream flavors but now if you ask pretty
much any kid in the world what their
dream job is all of them will probably
give you the same answer YouTuber or
more broadly online content creator so
streamer YouTuber things like that and
it's a dream job for more than just
children obviously they're people of all
ages that very much want some kind of
online presence as a career and it's
just become a very sought after
occupation there are more people hunting
after and an online career than there
were assassins hunting after John Wick
and the reason I mentioned this is
because there's recently been a rise in
the frequency of large content creators
expressing burnout as well as just being
completely miserable by the content
creation grind needing to take long
breaks or just outright announcing that
they're quitting altogether in fact
that's what we're talking about today
that's the subject that I want to go
over because tfu just made a very
heartfelt video saying goodbye to his
audience talking about how all the
decade plus long grind he's been
embarked on has kind of made him feel
like his life is slipped away from him
he doesn't regret any of his choices but
he recognized that he spent the majority
of his life just behind a computer
screen and wants to really finally feel
free to live the life that he feels will
be the happiest for him so he made this
video which is kind of like the ending
credits to like a franchise finale where
it just goes over the you know best of
moments throughout his life online and
he's says that he's kind of just hanging
up his hat he's retiring the jersey
number he's stepping away from streaming
and making content if he doesn't know
how long he says he'll likely be back at
some point but it won't be for a long
time again if he ever does come back at
all and this isn't the first big content
creator to say something like this and
just within the last week PewDiePie also
recently made an announcement about how
he finally feels free from the content
grind now that he lives in Japan he's
got his baby like there are a lot of
examples of this over the last year
alone of huge content creators that are
just kind of ready to move on from
making content online and I wanted to go
over why because again this is a dream
job for so so many people and this is
something I've always said and I'll once
again scream it from the mountaintops
here being a YouTuber or a streamer is
the luckiest position you can ever have
and in most case cases is legitimately
easier than nine to five jobs outside of
the internet or other positions that
exist outside of the internet when you
are an online creator for the most part
you get to choose your own hours it's
very flexible on what content you're
making or what you really want your
online footprint to be you are in
control for the most part which is a
luxury most people 99 of people in the
world don't get to experience so how
could there even come a time where
someone's just like really tired of it
or made miserable by it and I kind of
just want to look at that because it's
not like these creators are geriatric
now it's not like they spent 40 years in
the industry and they're just finally
ready to just say you know kapuli I'm
done here like these are still young
people tifu's 25 years old he has been
online for over a decade though
PewDiePie is in his early 30s and he's
been online for over a decade as well so
they have been in the industries for I
mean pretty much since the infancy of
this whole space but they're not like
super old so how does it get to the
point where they're just really that
done with it at such a young age that's
what I kind of want to explore here so
in tifu's video it's a very honest and
open look at what his content creation
Journey felt like where he was streaming
all the time making videos all the time
and he felt trapped by it now he does
mention something that many people
aren't going to sympathize too hard with
and I understand why he mentions that
having to stream six to eight hours a
day every day was brutal and draining
and a lot of people recognize that
that's kind of just normal nine to five
job hours like that's less than nine to
five job hours and most people don't
have a job that they love or a job
that's fun like playing video games and
they're certainly not making millions of
dollars playing video games for the six
to eight hour period right so it's
something that a lot of people kind of
roll their eyes at and I do get it
because because again it is a dream
position however it doesn't like nullify
his feelings on it being forced to play
basically one or two games or basically
just one type of game forever otherwise
viewers drop off being forced to never
really take a break because then you
lose so many Subs like it is still a
draining thing for sure in a different
way you kind of become a prisoner of
consistency or else you risk taking a
big hit to your income for the month so
it is a mentally damaging thing to feel
forced to do [ __ ] you don't want to do
for a long period of time which I'm sure
a lot of people in the normal working
world can also relate to let me give you
a quick example I stream daily and I've
streamed daily for the last six or so
years however two months ago I had to
take four days off well it's not like I
had to take it it wasn't like a [ __ ]
government mandated vacation or anything
I usually will only take like maybe one
day a month if something came up and it
was too late to stream so very rarely
will you see me not online for four days
in a row that's apocalyptic vacation
time for Charles there that's that [ __ ]
where the audience got concerned and
like damn we might need a search and
rescue team like Charles might be in
trouble here this could be a message a
deeper message so I had four days where
I didn't stream in a row because a lot
had came up and I just really wasn't
able to and when I did come back I lost
8 000 subscribers 8 000 subscribers out
of the 20 I think it was 26 000 Subs I
had at the time just vanished in an
instant because I took four days off
from streaming and I still haven't
gotten them back it's not like they all
just came back once I was online again
now this isn't some complaint or pity
party here because I recognize how
unbelievably lucky I am to be in the
position that I am I am one of the
luckiest people in the world to be able
to do what I do so this happening wasn't
like some kind of shock or something
that made me upset or anything like that
that this was something I absolutely
knew was coming after four days off
because I'd seen it happen to so many
other large creators this was one of the
main motivators behind Ludwig's
sub-a-thon if I remember correctly he
took like a week-long vacation and lost
like 10 000 subs and kind of panicked to
try to try and get them back and did the
subathon I remember tyler1 uh made a
quick a quick statement on stream after
a short time off where he's like man I
lost 15 000 subscribers and this is just
something that happens if you're not
there every single night basically on
streaming since the online audience is
always frothing at the mouth for Content
they'll find other streamers elsewhere
to fill that void because it's such a
competitive space maybe they come back
maybe they don't and maybe they do come
back but they don't have a twitch Prime
right like there's just so many things
at play that do ultimately have a big
impact on the person's income when
they're a streamer which is why you very
rarely see streamers take a long
vacation or even if they do take a
vacation they still stream during it
because it's kind of scary scary not to
because even just taking one day off can
result in a drastic decline overnight
basically so for tifu to talk about this
like I understand the perspective where
if he wasn't streaming every single day
and I I know he had a twitch contract so
I also had minimum minimum hour
guaranteed that he had to hit which I
imagine was probably like 160 or maybe
180 hours would be my guess but I'm just
speculating if he's not doing that every
single day it's hard to make up those
hours and it's also hard to hold on to
his audience and that sub that
subscriber base so it could absolutely
be a really mentally shitty thing to go
through so I understand why that would
be frustrating and make him feel like
you know he can't really set aside time
to do other things that he wants to do
outside of streaming and in the video he
said something that I think is a really
interesting look at how the perspective
shifts once someone reaches that level
and is kind of Trapped doing the same
stuff he said that in the beginning
gaming was an escape from reality but
now reality is an escape from gaming
Forum because it's now just become
something that he is completely
obligated to do and isn't finding enough
joy in anymore to make it feel like he's
spending his time in a in a good way
that makes him happy now he's in a very
fortunate position where he has
generational wealth he has Oodles of
clams Millions upon millions of dollars
that he can use to live his life to the
absolute fullest and do the most
thrilling [ __ ] imaginable if he chooses
to off the internet and I think he
recognizes how lucky he is because
there's countless people that would love
to just leave their nine to five to be
able to explore what makes them happiest
and that's fundamentally what tifu's
doing he's just in a fortunate lucky
position that he is financially secure
enough to just step away from his job
his career and this video is just
letting his audience know like guys I
really appreciate the support but it's
time to move on to the next chapter of
my life which I think is a totally
respectable thing now this is a question
I get asked a lot and especially more
recently because of so many YouTubers is
doing things like tifu is making these
announcements about very long breaks or
all this burnout that they're
experiencing or just outright Calling it
Quits I've been getting asked if there's
ever a period that I plan on stopping
you know making videos or streaming
because I've been making [ __ ] online
since 2007 so it's been a good 16 years
here I actually started in 2006 but I've
told all those stories quite a bit I'm
not just gonna give you the lore dump
yet again but you know I'm starting to
get a little gray in the face here so is
there ever a time where I just plan on
calling it quits and my answer is always
a resounding no me making [ __ ] online is
what makes me happiest I have always
been doing this [ __ ] because I have fun
doing it it's never been like an
obligation for me or something I feel
forced to do I've just always done it
purely for the love of it so I couldn't
imagine a time where I just hate it and
like get made miserable by it and need
to step away or something like that but
I always understand people who do and I
think one of the main contributing
factors to that that I've discussed a
lot is when a when a Creator gets kind
of pigeonholed into one type of content
and they feel like they can't Branch out
from it it leads to them getting really
made miserable by it feeling forced to
keep doing one thing forever no one
wants to do the same song and dance a
million times eventually they want to
try other things but online taking that
step to try other things is extremely
scary because it comes with a really
real risk of losing a lot of your
audience or making things that they
won't enjoy or you know just driving
people away and that's your entire
career that's your livelihood you you
can't really take chances like that for
a lot of creators so it's always a very
difficult thing to do but I think it's
the most rewarding thing as well because
there's very few people that will be
content making the exact same thing that
they've been making for a decade it
takes a very strong mental to keep doing
the same [ __ ] forever without wanting to
try other things but again for a lot of
creators they feel like they need to and
I think that's what really leads to a
lot of that burnout and that feeling of
needing to take breaks because the
endless grind monotony of just doing it
all day after day this [ __ ] same
stale routine gets to be draining so I
really think that a lot of the big
contributing factors that make other
creators burn out I don't really have
myself because I do such an incredibly
large variety of content and so much
different [ __ ] like literally we just
started a wrestling league our own
wrestling promotion a few months ago
that we're going so hog wild with like
we're constantly doing new things I'm
constantly trying different types of
content doing all kinds of wild [ __ ] so
I just never really experienced that now
of course I can't speak for like 40
years in the future here but I just
don't really Envision a time where I'm
going to stop having fun making things
so right now I I don't I don't foresee a
future where I just call it quits on
creating content or anything like that
but again with all of these other
creators that are talking about this I
really do get it from their perspective
on how it gets to that point even with a
job like youtubing or streaming a dream
job so yeah I kind of just wanted to go
over this whole topic here I'm wishing
tifu the absolute best and I hope
whatever he decides to do now post
content creation is something that makes
them extremely happy he deserves it
everyone deserves to pursue what makes
them happiest and tfu is in a lucky
position that he gets to do that so
wishing him the best and anyone else
that's recently announced breaks or you
know Calling it Quits on content
creation I hope whatever they choose to
do next is something that makes them
feel very happy so yeah I just wanted to
talk about it that's about it so yeah
