  Replace these words with a series of paragraphs which describe the project in
  detail,

  each sentence of which becomes a task to be tracked.

  (Except sentences in parentheses, which only provide context for other tasks.)

  To break the narrative into sections, begin each section with a title in
  <i>italics</i> on its own line.

  Subsections, if any, have <u>underlined</u> titles.
