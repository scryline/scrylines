  **Overview**


  What is a concise one-paragraph overview of this project?

    

  **Chapter 1**


  Replace these words with a series of paragraphs which describe the project in
  detail, each sentence of which becomes a task to be tracked.


  (Except sentences in parentheses, which only provide context for other tasks.)


  To break the narrative into sections, begin each section with a title in
  _italics_ on its own line. Subsections, if any, have underlined titles.
