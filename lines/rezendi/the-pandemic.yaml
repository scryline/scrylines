    title: '“No handshakes, please”: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus'
    summary: >-
      Although public officials in the area say the virus is contained for now,
      some in the tech industry fear the virus will spread out of control.
    comments: >-
      <p>Hard to overstate how poorly this piece has aged. Some defended it as
      just-the-facts journalism. Those people were wrong. Consider "It’s unclear
      if Ulevitch was kidding" &amp; "the flu is a greater threat to Americans
      than the coronavirus … [which is] especially scary to the public,
      including Silicon Valley’s elite" &amp; "the extreme caution some are
      taking does raise questions about the appropriate level of response." All
      culminating in the classic "some say" as a stand-in for the open editorial
      voice: "some may see measures like no-handshake rules as a step too far,"
      immediately after blatantly linking them to xenophobia and racism.
      Sheeeesh.</p>
