    title: '“No handshakes, please”: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus'
    summary: >-
      Although public officials in the area say the virus is contained for now,
      some in the tech industry fear the virus will spread out of control.
    comments: >-
      <p>It's hard to overstate how poorly this piece has aged. Some defended it
      as just-the-facts journalism. Those people were wrong. Consider "It’s
      unclear if Ulevitch was kidding" &amp; "the flu is a greater threat to
      Americans than the coronavirus … [which is] especially scary to the
      public, including Silicon Valley’s elite" &amp; "the extreme caution some
      are taking does raise questions about the appropriate level of response."
      All culminating in the classic "some say" as a stand-in for the open
      editorial voice: "some may see measures like no-handshake rules as a step
      too far," immediately after blatantly linking them to xenophobia and
      racism. Sheeeesh.</p>
